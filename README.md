- Hi, I’m Travis. Also known around the web as @BeanJuice, it's a entendre of sorts. (hint: google JavaBeans)
- I’m interested in cybersecurity and coding is my passion.
- I’m currently working as an IT technician & building a few side projects out in between my certifications (AWS, CompTIA, ISC2)
- Moving forward, as of 27-05-2021 most of my commits will be hidden/in a private repo as I develop an independent, monetizable solution.
