- Hi, I’m Travis. Also known around the web as @BeanJuice, it's a bad pun on coffee and coding.
- I’m interested in cybersecurity and coding is my passion.
- I’m currently freelancing as a web dev & building a few side projects out in between my certifications (AWS, CompTIA, ISC2)
- As of 27-05-2021, most of my commits will be hidden/in a private repo as I develop a legacy healthcare appplication.
