- I’m interested in cybersecurity and coding is my passion.
- I’m currently working as a full-stack dev & building a few side projects out in between my certifications (AWS, CompTIA, ISC2).
- As of 2022 I'll be working C2C, as such, my personal github commits will be sporadic. [concluded 2023]
- Currently seeking my Security+ certification and expanding my programmatic skill set.
